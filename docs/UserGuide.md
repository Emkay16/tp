# Patient Manager User Guide

Patient Manager is a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) application for _general practitioners_ (GP)
who work in government polyclinics to manage their patient list. This includes a recording/retrieval of
past record of visit, scheduling of the next appointment, and some other features listed below.
With the Patient Manager, GPs will be able to reduce paperwork and have a more efficient way

## Features

> ❗ Notes about the command format:
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters supplied by the user.\
e.g. in `add IC_NUMBER`, `IC_NUMBER` is a parameter that has to be specified.\
(sample command: `add S1234567D`)
> 
> 
> - Parameters in square brackets are optional.\
e.g. for the `record [DATE] [/s SYMPTOM] [/d DIAGNOSIS] [/p PRESCRIPTION]` command,
both `record 26/03/2021 /s coughing` and `record /s fever /p panadol` are valid commands.
>
>
> - Parameters with `...` allow multiple parameters (including zero) to be specified.\
e.g. for `help [OPTIONAL_COMMAND]...` both `help` and `help add delete` are valid commands.
>
>
> - Parameters can be given in any order.\
e.g. if a command specifies `/s SYMPTOMS /p PRESCTIPTION` as its parameters,
`/p PRESCTIPTION /s SYMPTOMS` is also acceptable.
>
>
> - If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
the parameter will be taken.\
e.g. if you specify `/s coughing /s fever`, only `/s fever` will be taken.
>
>
> - Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.\
e.g. if the command given is `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
>
>
> - Dates must be specified in the format `dd/MM/yyyy`, for example, `05/03/2021`. All dates given must be valid,
according to the rules of the [Gregorian Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar).

### Print a help message: `help`

Prints out the help message with a brief explanation of the available commands. If one or more
commands are provided as arguments, the info messages for the indicated commands will be printed.
If invalid commands are given as arguments, Patient Manager will print an error message to inform the user
that the command does not exist.

Usage: `help [OPTIONAL_COMMAND]...`

```
help list load exit
```

### Displaying the current loaded patient: `current`

An optional `DATE` argument may be provided to modify previous visit records,
or to create a new record with the specified date. If the `DATE` parameter is
not specified, Patient Manager will execute the command with the current system date.

Usage: `record [DATE] [/s SYMPTOM] [/d DIAGNOSIS] [/p PRESCRIPTION]`

Example of usage:

```
